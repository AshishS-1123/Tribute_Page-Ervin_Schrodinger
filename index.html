                    Schrodinger is a Nobel Laurate and Austrian Physicist.<br>
                    He is most popular for his discovery of the Schrodinger Wave Equation.<br>
                    His thought-experiment paradox, known as Schrodinger's Cat, has turned into a rite-of-passage for physicist all over the world.<br>
                    His work, What Is Life?, inspired James Watson in his discovery of Human DNA.<br>

                    Son of Rudolf Schrodinger and Georgine Emilia Brenda Schrodinger.<br>
                    Studied in Vienna under Franz Exner and Friedrich Hasenohrl.<br>
                    Also performed experimental work under Friedrich Kohlrausch.<br>
                    Influenced by Arthur Schopenhauer and became deeply interested in color theory<br>
                    and philosophy.
